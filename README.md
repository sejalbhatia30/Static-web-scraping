# Static-web-scraping
Static web scarping using BeautifulSoup , urllib.request , and pandas
Static scraping ignores JavaScript. It fetches web pages from the server without the help of a browser. You get exactly what you see in “view page source”, and then you slice and dice it. 
Beautiful Soup is a very powerful library that makes web scraping by traversing the DOM (document object model) easier to implement.
urllib.request is used in this example to get the html content, BeautifulSoup to parse the html, and pandas to make a dataframe and write to a csv.
